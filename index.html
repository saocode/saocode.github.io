<td>Requirement 1: Install and Maintain Network Security Controls</td>
<td></td>
<td><b>Category</b><br><br>Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems<br><br> <b>Overview</b> <br><br>Network security controls (NSCs), such as firewalls and other network security technologies, are network policy enforcement points that typically control network traffic between two or more logical or physical network segments (or subnets) based on pre-defined policies or rules. <br><br>NSCs examine all network traffic entering (ingress) and leaving (egress) a segment and decide, based on the policies defined, whether the network traffic is allowed to pass or whether it should be rejected. Typically, NSCs are placed between environments with different security needs or levels of trust, however in some environments NSCs control the traffic to individual devices irrespective of trust boundaries. Policy enforcement generally occurs at layer 3 of the OSI model, but data present in higher layers is also frequently used to determine policy decisions. <br><br>Traditionally this function has been provided by physical firewalls; however, now this functionality may be provided by virtual devices, cloud access controls, virtualization/container systems, and other software-defined networking technology. <br><br>NSCs are used to control traffic within an entity’s own networks—for example, between highly sensitive and less sensitive areas—and also to protect the entity’s resources from exposure to untrusted networks. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is an example of a more sensitive area within an entity’s network. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into sensitive systems. NSCs provide a key protection mechanism for any computer network. <br><br>Common examples of untrusted networks include the Internet, dedicated connections such as business-to-business communication channels, wireless networks, carrier networks (such as cellular), third-party networks, and other sources outside the entity’s ability to control. Furthermore, untrusted networks also include corporate networks that are considered out-of-scope for PCI DSS, because they are not assessed, and therefore must be treated as untrusted because the existence of security controls has not been verified. While an entity may consider an internal network to be trusted from an infrastructure perspective, if a network is out of scope for PCI DSS, that network must be considered untrusted for PCI DSS. <br><br>Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.</td>

<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>Compromises often happen due to unused or insecure services (for example, telnet and FTP), protocols, and ports, since these can lead to unnecessary points of access being opened into the CDE. Additionally, services, protocols, and ports that are enabled but not in use are often overlooked and left unsecured and unpatched. By identifying the services, protocols, and ports necessary for business, entities can ensure that all other services, protocols, and ports are disabled or removed.<br><br><b>Good Practice</b><br><br>The security risk associated with each service, protocol, and port allowed should be understood. Approvals should be granted by personnel independent of those managing the configuration.

<td><b>Defined Approach Testing Procedures</b><br><br>1.4.3 Examine vendor documentation and configurations for NSCs to verify that anti-spoofing measures are implemented to detect and block forged source IP addresses from entering the trusted network.</td>
<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>Filtering packets coming into the trusted network helps to, among other things, ensure packets are not “spoofed” to appear as if they are coming from an organization’s own internal network. For example, anti-spoofing measures prevent internal addresses originating from the Internet from passing into the DMZ.<br><br><b>Good Practice</b><br><br>Products usually come with anti-spoofing set as a default and may not be configurable. Entities should consult the vendor's documentation for more information.<br><br><b>Examples</b><br><br>Normally, a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally sent it so other computers in the network know where the packet originated.<br><br>Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending IP address to fool the target system into believing the packet is from a trusted source.</td>

<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>Cardholder data that is directly accessible from an untrusted network, for example, because it is stored on a system within the DMZ or in a cloud database service, is easier for an external attacker to access because there are fewer defensive layers to penetrate. Using NSCs to ensure that system components that store cardholder data (such as a database or a file) can only be directly accessed from trusted networks can prevent unauthorized network traffic from reaching the system component.</td>

<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>Systems containing a combination of services, protocols, and daemons for their primary function will have a security profile appropriate to allow that function to operate effectively. For example, systems that need to be directly connected to the Internet would have a particular profile, like a DNS server, web server, or an e-commerce server. Conversely, other system components may operate a primary function comprising a different set of services, protocols, and daemons that perform functions that an entity does not want exposed to the Internet. This requirement aims to ensure that different functions do not impact the security profiles of other services in a way which may cause them to operate at a higher or lower security level.<br><br><b>Good Practice</b><br><br>Ideally, each function should be placed on different system components. This can be achieved by implementing only one primary function on each system component. Another option is to isolate primary functions on the same system component that have different security levels, for example, isolating web servers (which need to be directly connected to the Internet) from application and database servers.<br><br>(continued on next page)<br><br>If a system component contains primary functions that need different security levels, a third option is to implement additional controls to ensure that the resultant security level of the primary function(s) with higher security needs is not reduced by the presence of the lower security primary functions. Additionally, the functions with a lower security level should be isolated and/or secured to ensure they cannot access or affect the resources of another system function, and do not introduce security weaknesses to other functions on the same server.<br><br>Functions of differing security levels may be isolated by either physical or logical controls. For example, a database system should not also be hosting web services unless using controls like virtualization technologies to isolate and contain the functions into separate sub-systems. Another example is using virtual instances or providing dedicated memory access by system function.<br><br>Where virtualization technologies are used, the security levels should be identified and managed for each virtual component.

<td>Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data</td>

<td><b>Category</b><br><br>Protect Account Data<br><br> <b>Overview</b> <br><br>Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of account data protection. If an intruder circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted account data, the data is unreadable without the proper cryptographic keys and is unusable to that intruder. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential risk-mitigation opportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing account data unless necessary, truncating cardholder data if full PAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies such as e-mail and instant messaging. <br><br>If account data is present in non-persistent memory (for example, RAM, volatile memory), encryption of PAN is not required. However, proper controls must be in place to ensure that memory maintains a non-persistent state. Data should be removed from volatile memory once the business purpose (for example, the associated transaction) is complete. In the case that data storage becomes persistent, all applicable PCI DSS Requirements will apply including encryption of stored data. <br><br>Requirement 3 applies to protection of stored account data unless specifically called out in an individual requirement. <br><br>Refer to Appendix G for definitions of “strong cryptography” and other PCI DSS terms.</td>

<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>A formal data retention policy identifies what data needs to be retained, for how long, and where that data resides so it can be securely destroyed or deleted as soon as it is no longer needed. The only account data that may be stored after authorization is the primary account number or PAN (rendered unreadable), expiration date, cardholder name, and service code.<br><br>The storage of SAD data prior to the completion of the authorization process is also included in the data retention and disposal policy so that storage of this sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only retained for the defined amount of time.<br><br><b>Good Practice</b><br><br>When identifying locations of stored account data, consider all processes and personnel with access to the data, as data could have been moved and stored in different locations than originally defined. Storage locations that are often overlooked include backup and archive systems, removable data storage devices, paper-based media, and audio recordings.<br><br>To define appropriate retention requirements, an entity first needs to understand its own business needs as well as any legal or regulatory obligations that apply to its industry or to the type of data being retained. Implementing an automated process to ensure data is automatically and securely deleted upon its defined retention limit can help ensure that account data is not retained beyond what is necessary for business, legal, or regulatory purposes.<br><br>(continued on next page)<br><br>Methods of eliminating data when it exceeds the retention period include secure deletion to complete removal of the data or rendering it unrecoverable and unable to be reconstructed. Identifying and securely eliminating stored data that has exceeded its specified retention period prevents unnecessary retention of data that is no longer needed. This process may be automated, manual, or a combination of both.<br><br>The deletion function in most operating systems is not “secure deletion” as it allows deleted data to be recovered, so instead, a dedicated secure deletion function or application must be used to make data unrecoverable.<br><br>Remember, if you don't need it, don't store it!<br><br><b>Examples</b><br><br>An automated, programmatic procedure could be run to locate and remove data, or a manual review of data storage areas could be performed. Whichever method is used, it is a good idea to monitor the process to ensure it is completed successfully, and that the results are recorded and validated as being complete.

This provides no protection from a malicious individual that has already managed to gain access to a valid user account.<br><br><b>Good Practice</b><br><br>Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is best limited only to removable electronic media storage devices.</td>

<td><b>Category</b><br><br>Protect Account Data<br><br> <b>Overview</b> <br><br>The use of strong cryptography provides greater assurance in preserving data confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. <br><br>To protect against compromise, PAN must be encrypted during transmission over networks that are easily accessed by malicious individuals, including untrusted and public networks. Misconfigured wireless networks and vulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocols continue to be targeted by malicious individuals aiming to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to cardholder data environments (CDE). Any transmissions of cardholder data over an entity’s internal network(s) will naturally bring that network into scope for PCI DSS since that network stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data. Any such networks must be evaluated and assessed against applicable PCI DSS requirements. <br><br>Requirement 4 applies to transmissions of PAN unless specifically called out in an individual requirement. <br><br>PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both.

<td><b>Category</b><br><br>Implement Strong Access Control Measures<br><br> <b>Overview</b> <br><br>Unauthorized individuals may gain access to critical data or systems due to ineffective access control rules and definitions. To ensure critical data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, systems and processes must be in place to limit access based on need to know and according to job responsibilities. <br><br>“Access” or “access rights” are created by rules that provide users access to systems, applications, and data, while “privileges” allow a user to perform a specific action or function in relation to that system, application, or data. For example, a user may have access rights to specific data, but whether they can only read that data, or can also change or delete the data is determined by the user’s assigned privileges. <br><br>“Need to know” refers to providing access to only the least amount of data needed to perform a job. <br><br>“Least privileges” refers to providing only the minimum level of privileges needed to perform a job. <br><br>These requirements apply to user accounts and access for employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors and other third parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services).

This principle is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft of resources. For example, 1) dividing mission- critical functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or functions, 2) establishing roles such that information system support activities are performed by different functions/individuals (for example, system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.<br><br>In environments where one individual performs multiple functions, such as administration and security operations, duties may be assigned so that no single individual has end-to-end control of a process without an independent checkpoint.

When each user or process can be uniquely identified, it ensures there is accountability for actions performed by that identity. When such accountability is in place, actions taken can be traced to known and authorized users and processes. <br><br>The element used to prove or verify the identity is known as the authentication factor. Authentication factors are 1) something you know, such as a password or passphrase, 2) something you have, such as a token device or smart card, or 3) something you are, such as a biometric element. <br><br>The ID and the authentication factor together are considered authentication credentials and are used to gain access to the rights and privileges associated with a user, application, system, or service accounts. <br><br>These requirements for identity and authentication are based on industry-accepted security principles and best practices to support the payment ecosystem. NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines provides additional information on acceptable frameworks for digital identity and authentication factors. It is important to note that the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines is intended for US Federal Agencies and should be viewed in its entirety. Many of the concepts and approaches defined in these guidelines are expected to work with each other and not as standalone parameters. <br><br>Note: Unless otherwise stated in the requirement, these requirements apply to all accounts on all system components, unless specifically called out in an individual requirement, including but not limited to: <br><br> Point-of-sale accounts <br><br> Accounts with administrative capabilities <br><br> System and application accounts <br><br> All accounts used to view or access cardholder data or to access systems with cardholder data. <br><br>This includes accounts used by employees, contractors, consultants, internal and external vendors, and other third parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services). <br><br>Certain requirements are not intended to apply to user accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction. When items do not apply, they are noted directly within the specific requirement. <br><br>These requirements do not apply to accounts used by consumers (cardholders). <br><br>Refer to Appendix G for definitions of PCI DSS terms.</td>

Requirements that specifically refer to the cardholder data environment (CDE) are intended to apply to the entire CDE, including any sensitive areas residing within the CDE. <br><br>3. Requirements that specifically refer to the facility are referencing the types of controls that may be managed more broadly at the physical boundary of a business premise (such as a building) within which CDEs and sensitive areas reside. These controls often exist outside a CDE or sensitive area, for example a guard desk that identifies, badges, and logs visitors. The term “facility” is used to recognize that these controls may exist at different places within a facility, for instance, at building entry or at an internal entrance to a data center or office space. <br><br>Refer to Appendix G for definitions of “media,” “personnel,” “sensitive areas,” “visitors,” and other PCI DSS terms.</td>

<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>Criminals will often pose as authorized maintenance personnel to gain access to POI devices.<br><br><b>Good Practice</b><br><br>Personnel training should include being alert to and questioning anyone who shows up to do POI maintenance to ensure they are authorized and have a valid work order, including any agents, maintenance or repair personnel, technicians, service providers, or other third parties. All third parties requesting access to devices should always be verified before being provided access—for example, by checking with management or phoning the POI maintenance company, such as the vendor or acquirer, for verification. Many criminals will try to fool personnel by dressing for the part (for example, carrying toolboxes and dressed in work apparel), and could also be knowledgeable about locations of devices, so personnel should be trained to always follow procedures.<br><br>Another trick that criminals use is to send a “new” POI device with instructions for swapping it with a legitimate device and “returning” the legitimate device. The criminals may even provide return postage to their specified address. Therefore, personnel should always verify with their manager or supplier that the device is legitimate and came from a trusted source before installing it or using it for business.<br><br>(continued on next page)<br><br><b>Examples</b><br><br>Suspicious behavior that personnel should be aware of includes attempts by unknown persons to unplug or open devices.<br><br>Ensuring personnel are aware of mechanisms for reporting suspicious behavior and who to report such behavior to—for example, a manager or security officer—will help reduce the likelihood and potential impact of a device being tampered with or substituted.</td>

<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>Attackers spend a lot of time finding external and internal vulnerabilities to leverage to obtain access to cardholder data and then to exfiltrate that data. As such, entities need to test their networks thoroughly, just as an attacker would do. This testing allows the entity to identify and remediate weakness that might be leveraged to compromise the entity’s network and data, and then to take appropriate actions to protect the network and system components from such attacks.<br><br><b>Good Practice</b><br><br>Penetration testing techniques will differ based on an organization’s needs and structure and should be suitable for the tested environment—for example, fuzzing, injection, and forgery tests might be appropriate. The type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the needs of the organization.<br><br><b>Definitions</b><br><br>Penetration tests simulate a real-world attack situation intending to identify how far an attacker could penetrate an environment, given differing amounts of information provided to the tester. This allows an entity to better understand its potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks. A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that usually includes exploiting identified vulnerabilities.<br><br>(continued on next page)<br><br>Scanning for vulnerabilities alone is not a penetration test, nor is a penetration test adequate if the focus is solely on trying to exploit vulnerabilities found in a vulnerability scan. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps, but it is not the only step a penetration tester will perform to plan the testing strategy. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.<br><br>Penetration testing is a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to gain access into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with the goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a way to gain access to an application server, the tester will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources to which the server has access. In this way, a tester can simulate the techniques used by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. The testing of security monitoring and detection methods—for example, to confirm the effectiveness of logging and file integrity monitoring mechanisms, should also be considered.<br><br>(continued on next page)<br><br><b>Further Information</b><br><br>Refer to the Information Supplement: Penetration Testing Guidance for additional guidance.<br><br>Industry-accepted penetration testing approaches include:<br><br>The Open Source Security Testing Methodology and Manual (OSSTMM)<br><br>Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) penetration testing programs.</td>

<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>Internal penetration testing serves two purposes. Firstly, just like an external penetration test, it discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be used by an attacker that had managed to get some degree of access to the internal network, whether that is because the attacker is an authorized user conducting unauthorized activities, or an external attacker that had managed to penetrate the entity’s perimeter.<br><br>Secondly, internal penetration testing also helps entities to discover where their change control process failed by detecting previously unknown systems. Additionally, it verifies the status of many of the controls operating within the CDE.<br><br>A penetration test is not truly a “test” because the outcome of a penetration test is not something that can be classified as a “pass” or a “fail.” The best outcome of a test is a catalog of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that an entity<br><br>did not know about, and the penetration tester</td>

<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>Some PCI DSS requirements allow an entity to define how frequently an activity is performed based on the risk to the entity’s environment. Performing this risk analysis according to a methodology ensures validity and consistency with policies and procedures.<br><br>This targeted risk analysis (as opposed to a traditional enterprise-wide risk assessment) focuses on those PCI DSS requirements that allow an entity flexibility about how frequently an entity performs a given control.

Examples of factors that could contribute to likelihood or impact include any that could increase the vulnerability of an asset to a threat—for example, exposure to untrusted networks, complexity of environment, or high staff turnover—as well as the criticality of the system components, or volume and sensitivity of the data, being protected.<br><br>(continued on next page)<br><br>Reviewing the results of these targeted risk analyses at least once every 12 months and upon changes that could impact the risk to the environment allows the organization to ensure the risk analysis results remain current with organizational changes and evolving threats, trends, and technologies, and that the selected frequencies still adequately address the entity’s risk.<br><br><b>Good Practice</b><br><br>An enterprise-wide risk assessment, which is a point-in-time activity that enables entities to identify threats and associated vulnerabilities, is recommended, but is not required, for entities to determine and understand broader and emerging threats with the potential to negatively impact its business.

In addition, multi-tenant service providers must meet the requirements in this Appendix. <br><br>Multi-tenant service providers are a type of third-party service provider that offers various shared services to merchants and other service providers, where customers share system resources (such as physical or virtual servers), infrastructure, applications (including Software as a Service (SaaS)), and/or databases. Services may include, but are not limited to, hosting multiple entities on a single shared server, providing e-commerce and/or “shopping cart” services, web- based hosting services, payment applications, various cloud applications and services, and payment gateway and processor services offered in a shared environment. <br><br>Service providers that provide only shared data center services (often called co-location or “co-lo” providers), where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available on a rental basis, are not considered multi-tenant service providers for purposes of this Appendix. <br><br>Note: Even though a multi-tenant service provider may meet these requirements, each customer is still responsible to comply with the PCI DSS requirements that are applicable to its environment and validate compliance as applicable. Often, there are PCI DSS requirements for which responsibility is shared between the provider and the customer (for perhaps different aspects of the environment). Requirements 12.8 and 12.9 delineate requirements specific to the relationships between all third-party service providers (TPSPs) and their customers, and the responsibilities of both. This includes defining the specific services the customer is receiving, along with which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the customer to meet, which are the responsibility of the TPSP, and which requirements are shared between both customer and the TPSP.</td>

Additionally, SSL and/or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where those protocols don’t already exist. At the time of publication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment terminals. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any time, and it is up to the organization to remain up to date with vulnerability trends and determine whether it is susceptible to any known exploits. <br><br>The PCI DSS requirements directly affected are: <br><br>• Requirement 2.2.5: Where any insecure services, protocols, or daemons are present; business justification is documented, and additional security features are documented and implemented that reduce the risk of using insecure services, protocols, or daemons. <br><br>• Requirement 2.2.7: All non-console administrative access is encrypted using strong cryptography. <br><br>• Requirement 4.2.1: Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks. <br><br>SSL and early TLS must not be used as a security control to meet these requirements, except in the case of POS POI terminal connections, as detailed in this appendix. To support entities working to migrate from SSL/early TLS on POS POI terminals, the following provisions are included: <br><br>• New POS POI terminal implementations must not use SSL or early TLS as a security control. <br><br>• All POS POI terminal service providers must provide a secure service offering. <br><br>• Service providers supporting existing POS POI terminal implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place. <br><br>• POS POI terminals in card-present environments that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS, and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect, may continue using SSL/early TLS as a security control. <br><br>Requirements in this Appendix are not eligible for the Customized Approach.</td>

<td><b>Defined Approach Requirements</b><br><br>A3.5.1 A methodology is implemented for the prompt identification of attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems that includes:<br><br>• Identification of anomalies or suspicious activity as it occurs.<br><br>• Issuance of prompt alerts upon detection of suspicious activity or anomaly to responsible personnel.<br><br>• Response to alerts in accordance with documented response procedures.<br><br>PCI DSS Reference: Requirements 10, 12<br><br><b>Customized Approach Objective</b><br><br>This requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.</td>
<td><b>Defined Approach Testing Procedures</b><br><br>A3.5.1.a Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify a methodology is defined and implemented to identify attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems in a prompt manner, and includes all elements specified in this requirement.<br><br>A3.5.1.b Examine incident response procedures and interview responsible personnel to verify that:<br><br>• On-call personnel receive prompt alerts.<br><br>• Alerts are responded to per documented response procedures.</td>
<td><b>Purpose</b><br><br>The ability to identify attack patterns and undesirable behavior across systems—for example, using centrally managed or automated log-correlation tools— is critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The presence of logs in all environments allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when something goes wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is very difficult, if not impossible, without a process to corroborate information from critical system components and systems that perform security functions, such as network security controls, IDS/IPS, and file integrity monitoring (FIM) systems. Thus, logs for all critical system components and systems that perform security functions need to be collected, correlated, and maintained. This could include using software products and service methodologies to provide real-time analysis, alerting, and reporting, such as security information and event management (SIEM), FIM, or change detection.</td>
